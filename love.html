    <h3>third anniversary letter🫶🏻💖💫🤭💌</h3>
     <p> 
        i just can't believe how long its been? THREE YEARS????? but i want our love to last for another THREE CENTURIES :P 
        i love you i love you i love you i love you i only love you the way i love you. i really don't know where to even begin writing, i just feel there is alwasy something left
        to say no matter how much i keep reminding how much i love you, it is never enough for me. so this is a very small gesture from me trying to show how much important
        you are for me🥺 anyways back to the point where it all started, will never forget the day i met you💗 still get butterflies just by thinking about that day omg.
        well, i met you in a very bad phase of my life :( that is why i took few months to open up. but despite of that you never gave up, you always loved me, showed me efforts,
        took well care of me. i will always be so so grateful for those times🥺🥺🥹🥹🥹 i never believed i even deserve love.
    </p>

    to be honest i never knew what power of love is until you loved me🧸🍀 you helped me become confident, you'd always push me to get out of my comfort zone😭😭😭😭😭
    omg supportive king😚😚😚 this love actually made me so brave and made me do things i never did before. i started studying hard so we could go on better dates xD
    i miss how childish i was xD it's funny how i was really gareeb back in 2021 but in 2021 we had the best time of our lives, but now despite having money we barely meet😞
    brave toh ho hi gayi hu tumhare waje se, anxiety abhi bhi hai par kaafi kam zarur ho gayi hai🥹🥹🥹 tumhare aane ke pehle kabhi pata hi nahi tha pyaar itna mazboot bana 
    deta hai insaan ko🤌🏻🌹 it's like sirf tumhari kami thi, abh sab perfect sa lagta hai :')

    also made my dream of being in love true???? it was always my dream to have someone to love, to experience what love feels like. you have the title of my first love, 
    my first baby, my first boyfriend and my first husband. i think life is incomplete if u don't have someone to love, i love money but if there is no one to 
    share moments with then life seems pointless. and for that i have you💗. No matter how bad my week was, how much i fought with my mother at the end of the week
    meeting u made me feel better.  Love is crazy and believing in love is even crazier, this thing we are in is not for weak ones. Love is hard but the fact
    we both exist at the same time in the universe makes me believe we are meant for each other. The fact that i randomly downloaded okc when i wasn't even looking for a bf,
    the fact that we had a terrible first date, the fact that we gave up so many times but always came back to each other. these facts make me believe there is indeed
    a strong something im not ready to let go. every time i think of leaving you, there is something that holds me back, i wonder what is it? is it ur smile? ur eyes? or the fact that im afraid no one will love me the way you do! </p>

    i am clueless...all i know is i love you immensely, if you are earth then i want to be the sun and give you light even if i burn myself, if you are in a dark place
    i want to be the light you look for, if you are hurt i want to you to know i will love you so much that you forget all your scars, i wish next year you become kinder
    to yourself, you are very precious, please don't hurt yourself in anyway, it breaks my heart how kind you are towards others but why so harsh on yourself ?
    my dear i want you to know you are amazing, i love the way you are, i love your skin color, i love your biceps, i love your shoulders, i love how small your eyes become
when you smile, i love your hair, i love your eyelashes, i love how good dressing sense you have, i love how hygienic you are, i love how good you smell all the time.
i know deep down you are not happy with how you look sometimes but you have a kind heart does anything else really matter ? <br>
my love, the world is already very harsh on us, i will really appreciate if you act kinder to yourself, believe in yourself,
trust me i see a spark in you that is very rare🫶🏻💖💫
