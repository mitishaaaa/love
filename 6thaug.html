 <p style="font-family: verdana"> so i met him second time this week. actually he gave his charger to me and i forgot to return him. so i had to meet him on sunday too lmaooo. then we had lunch then went for a ride to powai. 
    the weather was so nice. on the way we even stopped at a bus stop for 5mins cos it started raining. then we had to leave cos he had to pee. but then he took me to show hiranandi area omgg it was so pretty
     like im in a different country cos i never saw a place like that in India. we almost got it into a fight i was quiet the entire ride back. we stopped near marol had 🍹then i was having so much anxiety to
      leave him. he was way too cute today cos he dropped all the way to andh stn. this is the most romantic thing he has done lately lol cutie pie. anyways i almost broke down. then we were heading towards the
       metro stn right in between there was this building we had to go thru and it was so scary. almost shit my pants. but we reached safely. fought to him for near 10 mins that i dont wanna go home, i wanna drop him back
        to marol. i literally begged. but he got angry and said no. i almost cried but then stopped and came back home. it was a good day   ♡(*>ω<)♡

ohhh i forgot to write the highlight of the day🤭
we kissed in the auto on our way to andh stn. it was so funny cos i was rejecting him and he got frustrated but then i looked into his eyes and we kissed couple of times. <br>
