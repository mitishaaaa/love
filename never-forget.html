<p> I would really appreciate if you remember me, how much i love you and believe in you. I know you dont take my words seriously because tumhe lagta hai main tumhaare pyaar me andhi
  ho chuki hu. Thoda sa sach hi hai, par i also have immense RESPECT towards you as a human being. </p>
  <ul> <li> I see how hard working you are,</li>
           <li> how kind your heart is, the way you care for others, </li> 
           <li>the way you take responsibility for your family, </li>
           <li>  the way you keep wanting to become a better person,</li>
           <li>the way you keep calm even in difficult situations.</li>

  </ul>
 
<p>
These personality traits make you a MAN❤️ I am so proud of you, main chahti tum kabhi na bhulo tum kitne strong ho🥹 main yeh chiz bolti hu nahi kahi tumhara ego na badh jaaye
par you inspire me so fucking much love🤌🏻 dil se bol rahi hu, tumhe pata nahi but main copy karne ka try karti hu tumhari harkate🤭😝 jis tarah se tum consistent ho,
jis tarah se tum haar nahi maante yeh saari chize observe karti hu🥹🥺 kaafi baar "main amar hoon" tumhari yeh line yaad karti hu. i love how always positive you are.
tum itne strong ho ki dusro ko bhi behtaar banne ko inspire karte ho.🫶🏻 also never forget i am your NUMBER ONE FAN🫡 sometimes i feel like there is a wall between us.
You don't see it, but there is a wall, maybe you don't trust me enough to let me in. You certainly do hide things from me, it hurts me makes me feel like im not good
enough to be trusted. Wish that disappears soon and let me in completely. </p>
